This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by the incorrect use of the useEffect hook. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from the useEffect hook running after every render due to the empty dependency array.  This is fixed by adding `count` to the dependency array, ensuring the effect runs only when the `count` value changes.
